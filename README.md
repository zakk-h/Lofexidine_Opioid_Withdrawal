# Lofexidine and Opioid Withdrawal: Beyond the Impact of Blood Pressure

The information reported here results from secondary analyses of data from clinical trials conducted by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). Specifically, data from CSP-1020: A Phase III Placebo-Controlled, Double-Blind Multi-Site Trial of Lofexidine for Opiate Withdrawal were included. NIDA databases and information are available at [http://datashare.nida.nih.gov](http://datashare.nida.nih.gov)

This repository houses the research project "Lofexidine and Opioid Withdrawal: Beyond the Impact of Blood Pressure," conducted by a team of students in a research experience offered by the Department of Statistical Science at Duke University. 

## Project Overview

This study revisits the efficacy of Lofexidine, a medication traditionally used to manage blood pressure, in alleviating opioid withdrawal symptoms, independent of its blood pressure-lowering effects. The research aims to determine whether Lofexidine's impact on withdrawal symptoms can be distinguished from its effects on blood pressure.

### What Was Done

- **Data Analysis**: Utilized datasets from a previous study by Yu et al., modifying the MHOWS (Modified Himmelsbach Opiate Withdrawal Scale) to exclude blood pressure effects.
- **Statistical Modeling**: Implemented regression models to control for variables such as age and tobacco use, ensuring a focused examination of Lofexidineâ€™s direct effects.
- **Imputation Techniques**: Addressed missing data with robust imputation methods to maintain the integrity of our analysis.

The findings and materials in this repository include analysis scripts, results, and documentation that provide insights into the methodology and conclusions of our study. The data may be requested from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (see beginning).
